In order to solve this problem, we need to take into consideration several factors:

1. Abhimanyu's initial power.
2. The power of each enemy in the circles.
3. The ability for Abhimanyu to skip enemies.
4. The ability for Abhimanyu to recharge his power.
5. Special cases where enemies k3 and k7 can regenerate and attack Abhimanyu from behind.

To achieve this, we can make use of a simple loop to simulate Abhimanyu's journey through the circles, with special cases for enemies k3 and k7.

In this code, we define a function `canSurviveChakravyuh()` that receives the enemy powers, the initial power of Abhimanyu, the number of skips, and the number of recharges as parameters.

This function uses a while loop to simulate the journey of Abhimanyu through the circles. If Abhimanyu has enough power, he proceeds to the next circle. If he doesn't, he checks if he can skip or recharge.
If he can't do either, the function returns false, meaning Abhimanyu can't survive the Chakravyuh. If he manages to go through all the circles, the function returns true.

The `main()` function tests this with two sets of enemies. We may adjust these values to better suit your needs.
